# 2D Effectors

## Surface Effector 2D
Apply force like a conveyor belt

## Area Effector
Apply force within a certain (collider) area

## Point Effector 2D
Force Magnitude - negative to attract and positive to repel
Force Mode - Inverse squared (Newton) is the most realistic

## Buoyancy Effector
Most commom use-case is for water/fluids
Surface level - locatin of buoyant fluid
Flow group - can add movement/force direction like a river flowing

## Platform Effector
Use for one-way collision platforms
